# NP545XLA — Linux on Samsung Galaxy Book Go 5G

Hardware research, ACPI analysis, and device tree for the Samsung Galaxy Book Go 5G (NP545XLA), powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 (SC8180XP).

The build work (kernel, ISO) lives in [NP545XLA-kernel](https://github.com/potassium-os/NP545XLA-kernel). This repo is the hardware reference.

## The Problem

SC8180XP is the only 8cx generation without mainline kernel support. It was explicitly excluded from the Qualcomm/Lenovo/Arm/Linaro aarch64-laptops collaboration that brought up the other 8cx chips. No device tree existed for this laptop. ACPI-only boot gives you basic framebuffer and USB — nothing else.

## What We Found

- **Samsung UEFI only boots ISOs** — raw disk images with GPT ESP are invisible. Must be an El Torito ISO with an appended FAT ESP partition.
- **Ubuntu generic kernel doesn't work** — missing `gcc-sc8180x`, `qnoc-sc8180x`, `rpmhpd`. Everything defers forever in a circular dependency chain.
- **SMMU timeout (-110)** is the root blocker — clocks and power domains never come up without the sc8180x-specific drivers.
- **Serial console is dead** — 3.5mm combo jack with 150KΩ resistor, hardware issue not yet resolved.
- **`nomodeset + break=top` works** — framebuffer is functional, initramfs shell appears. Just no keyboard input yet.

## Status

| Subsystem | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Custom kernel | 🔧 Building (NP545XLA-kernel repo) |
| Boot ISO | 🔧 Building (NP545XLA-kernel repo) |
| Framebuffer | ✅ Works with nomodeset |
| Initramfs shell | ✅ Works |
| USB keyboard | 🔧 Expected to work with custom kernel |
| UFS storage | 🔧 Expected to work with custom kernel |
| Serial console | ❌ Hardware issue |
| Display | ❌ Not started |
| Keyboard | ❌ Not started |
| Touchpad | ❌ Not started |
| WiFi | ❌ Not started |
